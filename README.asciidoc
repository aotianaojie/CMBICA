README for CMBICA
=================

**Warning**: This repository is currently archived.

Introduction
------------
CMBICA is a Python program to run the FastICA algorithm over maps of the
microwave sky, with the intent to separate the signal of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) from other foreground signals (like e.g. synchrotron). It is a
complete rewrite of a Fortran90 program written by Carlo Burigana, Andrea
Farusi and Davide Maino. This rewrite exploits a number of "new" programming
concept, like the usage of http://www.literateprogramming.com/[literate
programming] approach (using http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/[Noweb]) and the
extensive use of test cases to validate the code.

Supported platforms
-------------------

CMBICA has been developed on Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6, but it can be run also
on Linux (and probably any other Unix machine). I am happy to implement patches
that allow the library to be used on other systems as well.

Installation
------------
Before compiling and installing the software, you have to install the following
components:

- http://www.python.org/[Python] (at least version 2.5) -- if you are using
  a Unix system or Mac OS X, there are good chances that you already have
  it;
- http://numpy.scipy.org/[NumPy], a Python library;
- http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits[PyFITS], a Python
  library to load FITS files;
- http://code.google.com/p/healpy/[HealPy], a Python port of the famous
  http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/[Healpix] library.
- To create the documentation, you need to have LaTeX and the `texi2pdf` script
  installed.

Python libraries can easily be installed using the `easy_install` script or
other platform-specific tools like `port` under Mac or `apt-get` under Ubuntu
Linux. Remember however that some of them might not have been ported to your
platform yet (this is most likely for HealPy).

To create both the Python executable and the documentation (in PDF) format,
just run `make` (or `gmake`).

Usage
-----
To use the program, you have to write a _parameter file_, that is a text file
containing the information needed by the program to do its job. This includes
the path to all the FITS files (in the Healpix format) containing the sky maps,
the output files to write and optionally the mask to use in the process.
